The "average" value for a [[variables|variable]]

$$\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1} Y_i}{n}$$
$\bar Y$ indicates the mean of $Y$, which is equal to the sum of all values of $Y$, $Y_i$, divided by the total number of cases $n$.

Two attractuve characteristics of mean values:  
- [[zero-sum]] property 
- [[least-squares]] property

Because of these properties, the mean is also referred to as the **expected value** of a variable.
