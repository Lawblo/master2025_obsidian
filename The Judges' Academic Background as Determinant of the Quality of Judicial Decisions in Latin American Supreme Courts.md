*This article shows that the academic background of judges will determine the quality of their judicial decisions. Through ordinary least squares models, this research demonstrates that judges with better academic skills are more likely to produce qualitatively better judicial decisions. Contrary to what one would intuitively expect, salaries, workload, type of legal training, and courts specialization do not have a significant influence on the quality of judicial decisions. Thisresearch and its results are the first steps to building a comprehensive theory to evaluate the quality of judicial decisions in high courts.*

---
- Important to research the quality of judicialdecisions, because when judges perform better, public support for the judicial branch increases.  
- High-quality judicial decisions have a positive effect on the rule of law because they lead to trust in the legal system as an effective means to guarantee people's rights.
- Low-quality juducual decisions not only reduce trust in the juducual branch, but also increase the preception that legal problems can be solved through informal - and generally illegal - means.
# Findings
- Judges' academic background is a strong predictor of the quality of judicial decisions
- Neither professional experience nor studies abroad are statistically significant.
