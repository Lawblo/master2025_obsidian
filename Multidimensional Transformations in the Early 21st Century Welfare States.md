Argumenterer for at tidligere syn på velferdsstater har vært for smale, med fokus på for få dimensjoner, da særlig den kvantitative dimensjonen.

For å kunne se på mekanismene som påvirker velferdsreformer er det derfor nødvendig å se på tre dimensjoner: 
- Kvantitativ
- Arbeidsrettet, med aktive/passive goder
- Dekningsgrad

Bruk av disse **dimensjonene** gjør at man **lettere** kan vurdere mekanismer som gjør at det er **mulig** å utføre teoretisk **kompliserte reformer** av velferdsstaten. 

De **sentrale mekanismene** det pekes på er:
- **Politisk samarbeid** mellom regjeringer og grupperinger, som f.eks fagforeninger
- **Moderniseringskompromisser**. Kombinasjon av retrenchment + 'nye' funksjoner som krav om aktivitet, gender equality, økt dekning for marginale sosiale grupper.
- **Affordable credit claiming**. Utføring av relativt øknomisk rimelige utvidelser av velferd, men med høy synlighet for velgere. Nye velferdsprogrammer med lavere kostnad fanger mer oppmerksomhet en utvidelse av gamle programmer.
- **Dualisering** dekker den økte segmenteringen av arbeidsmarkedet, med insiders/outsiders. Særlig i land som har hatt stramme arbeidslover, men som nå har deregulert non-permanent employment contracts. Fokus på Sør-Europa, og noen Continental-Europa land. Insiders/outsiders dekker både skillet mellom fast og andre ansatte, men også mellom arbeidsledige og arbeidende. 


Research from early 2000's on process of welfare state transformation: 
- Took contextual developments seriously
	- globalization
	- climate of 'permantent austerity' where reforms took place
- Developed the tools needed to explain late 1990s:
	- resilience
	- immobilities
	- failed attempts at radical reform
	- divergence across welfare regimes

Have been more substantial change after 2000's.
Chapter assesses wheter previous tools need to be adapted for new developments.

Main emphasis is on the recognition of the **multidimensional character fo the process of welfare state transformation**.

Chapter **argues** that this approach provides a more complete picture, as well as a better understanding of the **mechanisms that are affecting social policy change** in the early 21st century.

## The Quantity Dimension
Previous understanding of the process of welfare state development as along the 'quantity' dimension.

Can be seen as more...
...narrow with specific changes in welfare policy
...broad, with the degree of **welfare effort**, such as expenditure as a percentage of GDP. With this view, change can only happen in two directions: **expansion** or **retrenchment**.

## Broad trends
During postwar years: **expansions**
Since 1970s: **retrenchment**

Quantity dimension does not cover all transformations. 

Impact on labor market, economy, and general society may differ based on differing kinds of welfare policies, such as **passive** vs **active** redistribution.

A multimiensional understanding of social policies is useful in accounting for recent reforms. 
- Coalition between employers and left-wing parties in strengthening subidized child-care.

## Additional dimensions
- **Pro-employment**
- Welfare arrangements **Limited vs encompassing** to sections of the population

### Multidimensionality in previous works
#### #esping-andersen, 1990 
"All spending does not count equally". Focused on *decommodification* as a solution. Covers **level of benefits** and **degree of universality**, but difficult to make sense of when combined into one dimension. 

#### #pierson, 2001 
Made it more explicit with three dimensions: 
- **cost-containment**
	- retrenchment
	- future limits on spending
- **re-commodification**
	- restriction of alternatives to participation in the labor market, byt tightening eligibility or cutting benefits
- **recalibration** 
	- welfare state adaption to changed socio-economic circumstances
	- 'rationalization'

##### **Negatives with Pierson's dimensions**
- Still only useful for the retrenchment vs expansion dimension. Recommodification and recalibration dimensions undertheorized by Pierson. 
- Dimensions are difficult to operationalize. 

## **Author argues** for **three dimensions**
- **Quantitative** dimension/**Level of protection**
	- Covers the size of social transfers
	- Big implications for economy and labor market
	- Higher level of protection are better at reducing income inequality
	- Higher level of protection comes with a higher tax burden
	- 
- **Pro-employment orientation** (**active** vs. **passive**)
	- Responsible for determining how the welfare state will interact with the labor market and wider economy. 
	- Active leads to more productive labor market and higher employment
	- Impact functioning of labor market.	
		- Better match between labor supply/demand
	- A shift from passive to more active provisions may be a crucial factor in improving the viability of European welfare states
- **Encompassing character** of **provision**/**extent of coverage**
	- Crucial to protection against social risk.
	- Determinant of distribution of resources

An increase in **de-regulation** of **non-standard employment** and **de-universalization** of **social protection coverage** has gone together to generate fewer social rights, as well as expose 'outsiders' to higher levels of economi and social uncertainy. This may have become a **key dimension** of **social stratification** in postindustrial societies where welfare states are reducing their reach. 

Although there may be more dimensions to consider, these three are seen as the most important for three reasons:
1. They jointly deifne the **impact that a welfare state** has on the broader **political economy** of a country
2. they largely determine the **social outcomes** of a **welfare arrangement**
3. A combined focus on these dimensions allows for the **identification** of the **political dynamics** that have shaped recent reforms.  

## The Mechanism of Multidimensional Processes
The multidimensional quality of welfare reform processes enables an identification of mechanisms that can facilitate theoretically difficult-to-adapt reforms. 
### Political Exchange
The political market, where the government exchanges goods (financial resource, social rights, administrative resources) with the social consensus provided by social partners, such as trade unions. 

Covers 'deals' between political actors, in which at least some of the preferences of eachparticipant are included. 
### Modernizing Compromises
Retrenchment + inclusion of new functions. Gender, marginal social groups, activisation. 
### Affordable Credit Claiming
Low cost, new programmes that are more visible to the public. Causes big public wins for parties, with low effect on budgets. 
### Dualization
Growing segmentation of labor markets, caused by countries with previous rigid labor laws that have deregilated non-permanent employment. Also effected by activization requirements, further increasing differences between employed vs unemployed. Mostly in Southern and Continental Europe. 

Germany + France: Divisions that originate in labor market regulations tend to be replicated in the welfare state. 

Social rights less developed for atypical workers. Differences in pension between current vs young workers. Younger cohorts are easier to target, as they're less likely to politically mobilize for something relatively far in the future. 

No clear pattern, as many countries trend towards more integration: 
- UK + Germany moved towards less differentiation among jobless people
	- In UK the differences between unemployment insurance and social assistance has almost disappeared. 

Core workers tend to be more vocal about rights, causing deregulation of labor markets at the margins. The 'easier route' for politicians. 

## The Face of the New Welfare State
### Domains of Uncertainty and Disagreement
#### Activation-turn
Some see this as a positive development of the role played by welfare states in the economy. Others regards it as an essentially punitive mechanism that has developed to push low skilled workers intlow quality jobs they'd otherwise avoid. 

Controversy partly solved by distinguishing different types of active social policy:

##### Good/Bad policies
- 'Good' policies -> improves human capital
- 'Bad' policies -> negative incentives

- 'Offensive' vs 'defensive' workfare (Torfing 1999) 
- 'Positive' vs 'negative' activation (Taylor-Gooby 2004)
- 'Liberal' vs 'universalistic' activation (Barbier 2004)

Limitations of the view of good/bad policies: 
- strong value-based bias
- Some active labor market policies do not fall in either category.
	- French 'insertion sociale' provide alternative to market employment, not a stepping stone towards it.
- Most effective programmes are not investing in human capital, but reinforcing work incentives and job search capacity.


##### Failure of reduction of poverty as proof of active policies
Argued by Cantillon 2010 and Emmenegger et al. 2012. 

Problematic to blame on activization, as it has happened it the context of a huge socio-economical transformation, with economic internationalization and structual transformation. 
- social change
- immigration 
- family instability

#### Uncertainty about the potential of a social investment strategy
**Social investment**: A highly inteventionist social policy strategy that concentrates its efforton the improvement of a country's human capital.  

Increasingly costly after financial crisis, but still most convincing move.   

#### Difficulties in understanding how inegalitarian pressures will be translated into policies
Crouch & Keune (ch. 3), Palier, Emmenegger et al. (ch. 11) suggest that the insider/outsider cleavage (dualization) is the most likely development. 
This is caused by politically powerful constituencies of insiders that can use their influence to protect their status, while newer entrants into the labor market are more exposed to economic and social risks. 

#### The Future of Dualization
The future of dualization development is uncertain. This is partly due to the insiders/outsiders' status being non-static in nature. In the medium term, a substantial proportion can move from one group to the other, as opposed to other views on social stratification, where groups tend to be less fluid. 

This also means that on a societal level, future change is difficult to predict. As older insiders reach retirement age, they may be replaced by new insiders who could sustain the dualized social model. Alternatively, the model could wither away. 

There are uncertainties in the medium- to long-term impact of the 2008 financial crisis, and the debt crisis in Southern Europe.
