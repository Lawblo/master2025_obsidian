Categorical variables are variables for which cases have values that are either different from or the same as the values for other cases, but about which we **cannot** make any universally holding ranking distinctions.

We generally want to understand the frequence with which each value of the variable occurs in our data. 

The only [[measurement|measure]] of [[central tendency]] that is appropriate for a categorical variable is the [[mode]].
