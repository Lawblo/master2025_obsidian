*Can weak judicual institutions facilitate the advancement of women to the high courts?* **We explore** the *relationship between weak institutions and gender diversification* by **analyzing** the *consequences of judicial reshuffles in Latin America*. Our **theory predicts** that *institutional disruptions will facilitate the appointment of women justices*, but only *when left parties control the nomination process*. **We test** this argument using *difference-in-differences and dynamic panel models* for 18 Latin American countries between 1961 and 2014. The **analysis** offers *support for our hypothesis*, but gains in gender diversification are *modest in size* and *hard to sustain* over time. **Political reshuffles may produce short-term advances for women in the judiciary**, but they **do not represent a path to substantive progress in gender equality**.

**Explores** the relationship between weak institutions and gender diversification by analysing the consequences of judicial reshiffles in Latin America.

**Theory predicts** that institutional disruptions will facilitate the appointment of women justices, but only when *left* parties control the nomination process.

**Tests argument** using [[difference-in-differences]] and [[dynamic panel models]] for 18 Latin American countries between 1961 and 2014. 

**Analysis supports** hypothesis, but gains in gender diversification are modest in size and hard to sustain.

# Why?
- Judicial purges remove incumbent men -> More space to include women judges 
- After purge some elite men may see court as diminished in power and thus as a less desirable posting, reducing supply of qualified men replacements.  
- Lowers barriers for women to enter, which left gov'ts take advantage of. 
- Could also be explained by increased demand for women justices.  
- Activists could take advantage of moments of crisis to pressure gov'ts.  
- In midst of reshuffle, perception that women are more submissive or cooperative than men - and therefore may be more pliable and less likely to exercuse checks on exec power could make them more attractive to selectors.  
- Perception that women are less corrupt may make them attractive nominees, when govt want to reestablish the notion that their judiciary is fair and independent.  
- Only purges and court packing result in gains for women judges -> siggests that left govts do not take every oppurtuniy they can to increase womens representation -> left govt power grabs make incumbents more vulnerable to domestic or international pressures to diversify.
