Usually not the primary means of hypothesis testing today. 

# Choosing the right bivariate hypothesis test
After data collection, consider the nature of dependent and independent [[variables]]s: 

|                         |             | **Independent variable type** |                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Dependent variable type** |             | **Categorical**               | **Continuous**              |
|                         | **Categorical** |*[[tabular analysis]]*           | probit/logit            |
|                         | **Continuous**  |*[[difference of means]]*        | *[[correlation coefficients]]* |


One common element across a wide range of statistical hypothesis tests is the [[p-value]]. 

Bivariate hypothesis tests:
- [[tabular analysis]]
- [[difference of means]]
- [[correlation coefficients]]
- [[bivariate regression]]

Can use [[scatter charts]] to get initial look at relationship between two continous variables. [[covariance|Covariance]] is a statistical way of summarizing the general pattern of association (or lack thereof) between two continous [[variables]].
