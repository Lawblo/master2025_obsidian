Used when testing two categorical variables.

Customary for dependent variable, ($Y$), to be displayed in the rows, and the independent variable, ($X$), to be displayed in the columns.
## Understanding the table
*Figure out*...
1. ...what the variables are that define the rows and columns of the table.
2. ...what the individual cell values represent.
3. ...what, if nay, general patterns you see.

## tabular analysis and [[statistical significance]]

In order to test for statistical significance, we use the **chi-squared**, ($\chi ^2$) test.

![[chi-squared]]

After calculating the value of $\chi^2$ we need to compare it to some predermined standard called a critical value:

[[critical value for chi-squared]]

If $\chi^2$ > critical value, then we conclude that there is a relationship between the two variables, and if it is less, we can't make that conclusion.
