**Informal rules**: 
*"socially shared rules, usually unwritten, that are created, communicated, and enforced outside of officially sanctioned channels"*

- Informal party practices are important for understanding the male political dominance and female underrepresentation
- Importance of investigate combination of formal and informal rules' impact on women's and men's political party participation.
- Slippage between formal rules and real world
- Informal rules can be difficult to identify
- Mens domination of politics has allowed them to set the *rules of the game*
	- Has caused political parties as we know them to be **deeply genderd organizations**
 
Many countries require a strong clientelist network as an informal presrequisite for becoming a candidate.

These *rules of the game* mean that women are far less likely rto be in strategic position with access to the resources needed to build and maintain these networks, maintain them, make political career, and gain electoral power. 

Rather than looking at formal and informal rules as separate and contrasting elements, it can be conzeptualized as a **continuum from highly formal to highly informal**.

>Formal rules aren't always institutionalized
>Informal rules can be institutionalized

This could mean that informal rules could override 
### Degree of Institutionalization of Rules in Place
Ex:

>Subjective informal selection criteria can be informally institutionalized within political parties in that they are widely know, accpeted, and enforced within a network of institutional actors, wheras formal selection criteria may be weitten down but not always institutionalized and implemented.

Should rather use a distinction between "*rules-in-form*" and "*rules-in-use*"

Informal party practices of quota subversion:
- running women in "no-hope" seats
- local patronage and priveleging of "favorite sons"
- electoral fraud

Important to do nore in depth research, with often time consuming methods, such as in-depth interviews an participant observation, both in order to find out whether formal rules really do structure behavior in practice, and to understand the role informal practices and conventions play in the selection process.
