*European courts have responded to increasing caseloads by providing justices or other actors with a higher degree of discretionary docket control. Does docket type - mandatory or discretionary - shape judicial behavior? Using a most similar systems research design regarding tax decisions in the Norwegian and Danish supreme courts, we show that **low-status litigants have a lower chance of winning under mandatory dockets**, and that **docket type conditions the effects of justices' preferences**. Our findings have implications for comparative judicial politicas and for institutional designs.*

---
**Mandatory dockets**: Cases that the court *must* adjudicate
**Discretionary dockets**: Cases that the courts *choose* to adjudicate even though they are under no obligation to do so.

**Existing research** show that variation in docket type can have a substantial influence of the functioning of high courts, the behavior of justices, and the outcomes of cases.

1. A discretionary docket is associated with higher dissent and reversal rates than a mandatory docket
	- No significant difference in dissent and reversal rate in lower court judges
2. Mandatory dockets shape case outcomes by facilitating appeals from low-status litigants.
3. Justices' preferences are more strongly expressed when they have discretionay docket control, compared to mandatory dockets.
