A measure of [[dispersion]].
The **variance**, $\sigma^2$, of $Y$ is equal to the sum of the squared differences between each $Y$ value, ($Y_i$), and its [[mean]] divided by the number of cases minus one: 
$$
\text{var}(Y)  
= \text{var}_y 
= s^2_y 
= \frac 
{\sum^n_{i=1}(Y_i - \bar Y)^2}
{n - 1}
$$

If theres no variation of $Y$ at all, $\sigma$ would be equal to zero. As individual cases are spread further and further from the mean, this calculation would increase. 

Variance conveys the spread of the data around the mean.

A more intuitive measure of variance is [[standard deviation]].
