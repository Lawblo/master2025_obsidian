*Judges rarely reveal their reasoning in their opinions when they are influencd by factors that they know they should not consider. The natural next question is how, when a judge is impropely influenced, he or she reasons to justify a biased decision. In a set of experiments using incumbent Chines judges, we first replicated the findings of previous studies that showed judges can be influenced by extra-legal factors. More importantly, we showed that judges may employ a range of legal techniques to rationalize decision biases. they interpret legal standards and legal concepts strategically, finess the applicability of law, infer or deny causation and foreseeability, and draw different conclusions from facts. Our findings provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave, and cast doubt on reasoned elaboration as a guarantee of judicial transparency and trustworthiness*

---

We find that judges can **use reasons to incorporate their personal feelings**. We provide evidence that they do so **using a wide range of legal techniques** and in many areas of the law: 
- from **interpreting legal standards** to **deciding applicability of law**
- from **inferring causation** to **confirming mere facts**. 

**Findings**... 
...cast doubt on the **effectiveness of reasoned elaboration as a means to ensure judicial transparency**
...provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave.

- Judicial reasoning is habitually and unusually one-sided, and filled with certainy.
- Most judicial opinions imply that even the very toughest case has a right and wrong answer and onlya fool woulddoubt that the author of the opinion had hiton the right one. 
- Judges decide cases with greater confidence thatn the realities of judicial making permits, and speak and write with more confidence than they feel.
# Previous research
- Examinined mechanisms that bias both probabilistic and analytic reasoning:  
	- hindsight bias
	- anchoring
	- probability neglect
	- emotional bias
	- identity protective cognition
- Irrelevant information can unduly influence judicial decision making.  
- Judgements rarely reveal the real reasons for their decisions when they have been influenced by factors they know they shoyld not have taken into account.
# This study...
- examines what **legal techniques** judges employ to **justify biased decisions**.
- provides an **empirical analysis** of the intersection between **biased judicial decision** and **reasoned elaboration**.

Study reports results of three experiments that covered this area.  
## Steps of the experiments
1.  The experiments induce the judges to make biased decisions by providing what should be strictly irrelevant. 
2. The judges were asked to provide reasons for their decisions, both by multiple choice, as well as open-ended space for their own answers.   
3. The stimulus was included in the short list of possible reasons the judges could choose. Hardly any judges identified the factor as their reason.
### Contract law 
1. A lease contract case involving liquidated damages and the court's discretion in lowering such damages. 
2. In the treatment condition, the defendant was described as maintaining an extramarital relationship with a corrupt government official. 
3. Judges decided differently between baseline and treatment group. Few, if any, identified the stimilus factor as their decision reason, but rather interpreted the legal standard concerning liquidated damages differently.
### Criminal law
1. A defendent who bred and sold parrots at home was charged with "illegal sale of precious and endangered animals and their related products" 
2. He was described a indulging in gambling in one experiment condition, and as a good father in the other condition. 
3. Similar pattern as case 1. Judges justified decisions by **interpreting a legal concept differently**, **applying different source of law**, and **drawing different conclusions from facts**.
### Torts
1. The defendant had stored oxygen tanks in his courtyard, which led to a large fire, and he was being sued for tort liability by a plaintiff who vouluntarily participated in firefighting but fell on the road and hurt himself. 
2. In one condition, the defendant was storing oxygen to produce crystal meth; in the other condition he did so to better care for his mother's lung disease. 
3. Judges inferred causation and forseeability different from the same facts.

It is possible that the judges ignored the stimulus factor intentionally or unintentionally.
- Possible that judges did not want to acknowledge their decision bias, even when they clearly knew they were biased.
- Possible that judges were not able to acknowledge their decision bias, even when the biasing factor was very salient.

Both possiblities are both plausible and problematic. 
# Generalization of the study
As the study was performed in China, where judges are supposed to confine themselves strictly to the role of applying laws, they should be less capable of manipulating decision outcomes. This suggests that findings can very likely be appied to judges in other countries.
# Conclusion
- **We find** that judges can use reasons to incorporate their personal feelings.
- **We provide evidence** that they do so using a wide range of legal techniques and in many areas of the law: from interpreting legal standards to deciding applicability of law and from inferring causation to confirming mere facts.
- **Our findings** cast doubt on the effectiveness of reasoned elaboration as a means to ensure judicial transparency, and provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave. 

How to reduce bias and constrain judicial discretionary power is a direction in which future research may proceed.
