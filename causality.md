Scientific theories are usually limitied to descriptions of relationships between a *single* cause, and a *single* effect. These theories are tested with [[bivariate]]. 
May be less used these days.
Social reality is usually [[multivariate]]. 

When its time for [[research design|design research]] to test theoretical ideas, we have to [[control]] for other possible causes.

# Different causal relationships
[[deterministic relationships]] are relationshipssuch that if some cause occurs, then the effect will occur *with certainty*.

[[probabilistic relationships]] mean that increases in $X$ are associated increases or deacreses in the probability of $Y$ occuring.

# Four hurdles of causal relationships
1. Is there a credible causal mechanism that connects $X$ to $Y$?
2. Can we rule out the possibility that $Y$ could cause $X$?
3. Is there [[covariance]] between $X$ and $Y$?
4. Have we [[control|controlled]] for all [[confounding variables]] $Z$ that might make the association between $X$ and $Y$ [[spurious]]?
