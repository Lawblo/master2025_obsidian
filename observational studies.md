Observational studies takes the world as it is and "observe" it.

# Definition:
>An observational study is a research design in which the researcher does *not* have control over values of the independent variable, which occur naturally. However, it is necessary that there be some degree of variability in the independent variable across cases, as well variation in the dependent variable. 
## Variants of observational studies
### [[cross-sectional measure|Cross-sectional]]
Focuses on variation across [[spatial units]] at a singe [[time-unit]]
### [[time-series measure|Time-series]]
Focuses on variation within a single spatialunit over multiple time units. 
# Observational or correlational studies?
Because of the lack of [[random assignment]] to [[treatment group|treatment groups]], as in [[experiments]], some scholars claim that it is impossible to speak of [[causality]] in observational studies, and therefore sometimes refer to them as **correlational studies**.

**However**, this view is not shared by all. If sufficient attention is paid to accounting for all of the [[control|other possible causes]] of the dependent variable that are suggested by current understanding, then we can make informed evaluation of our confidence that the independent variable does cause the dependent variable.

1. Depends on theory
2. Problematic
3. Yes
4. No 

# Difficulties with observational studies
Difficulties controlling for other possible causes of $Y$. Have to control for **all** other possible causes.
