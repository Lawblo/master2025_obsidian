A measure of the amount of variation ($\sigma^2$) or [[dispersion]] of a set of values.
Abbreviated to $SD$ or sigma ($\sigma$) for the population sd, or the $s$ for the sample sd.
$$
\text{sd}(Y) = sd_Y = s_Y = \sqrt{\text{var}(Y)} = 
\sqrt{
\frac
{\sum^n_{i=1}(Y_i - \bar Y)^2}
{n - 1}}
$$
The average difference between **values of $Y$** ($Y_i$) and the **mean of $Y$** ($\bar Y$).
