Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) is a test for tabular association. 
# Formula
$$\chi^{2} = \sum{\frac{ (O - E)^2} {E}}$$
- $O$ = observed number of cases in each cell 
- $E$ = expected number in each cell if there were no relationships 
- $(O - E)^2$ = The numbers in the cells 
- $\sum$ signifies that we sum over each cell in the table. 

If all observed values were exactly equal to the values that we expect if there were no relationship between the two variables, then $\chi^2 = 0$. The more the $O$ values differ from the $E$ values, the greater the value will be for $\chi^2$.
