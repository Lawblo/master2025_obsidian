Tells us what the model is off by on average.
Sometimes referred to as the standard error of the regression model. Provides a measure of the average accuracy of the model in the metroc of the dependent variable.
$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}\hat u^2_i}{n}}$$
The squaring and then taking the square root of the quantities in this formula are done to adjust for the fact that some of our resisudals will be positive, and some will be negative. 
Basically the average distance between the data points and the regression line.
