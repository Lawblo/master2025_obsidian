Lower [[p-value]]s increase our confidence that there is a relationship between two examined variables. A common way of referrig to this, is that the relationship between the variables is **statistically significant**.

Most social sciences use the standard of a p-value of 0.05 (\*\*) in order for a relationship to be statistically significant. Other standards are 0.1 (\*) and 0.01 (\*\*\*).

Finding that $X$ and $Y$ have a statistical significant relationship *does not* necessarily mean that the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is strong or, especially, that the relationship is causal. 

In order to talk about the **strenght** of the relationship requires a substantial knowledge of what it means for the value of $Y$ to change by a particular amount. 

In order to assess the [[causality|causal relationship]], we need to evaluate our [[theories|theory]].
