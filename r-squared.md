Typically written as $R^2$.

Ranges between zero and one, indicating the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the model.

In order to find $R^2$, we first need:
![[total sum of squares, TSS]] 
and 
![[residual sum of squares, RSS]]
Then  we can calculate $R^2$:
$$1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}$$
![[model sum of squares, MSS]] 
can also be used to calculate $R^2$:
$$R^2 = \frac{MSS}{TSS}$$
