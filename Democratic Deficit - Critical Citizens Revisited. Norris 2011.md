Book focuses on fears that democracies are suffering from a legitimacy crisis. -> How far the perceived democratic performance of any state diverges from public expectations.

Explanations: 
- Demand: Rising public aspirations for democracy
- Information: Negative new about government
- Supply: The performance and structure of democratic regimes
# General model of democratic deficits
**Demand side**: Rising public aspirations for democracy, due to growing cognitive and civic skills and evolving self-expression values.
$$\downarrow$$ 
**Intermediary**: Negative coverage of government and public affairs by the news media.
$$\downarrow$$ 
**Supply side**: Failure of demcratic or policy perfomance of the state to match public expectations.
$$\downarrow$$ 
**Democratic deficit**: Disparities between the perceived democratic performance and public aspirations.
$$\downarrow$$ 
**Consequences**:  For political activism, compliance with government, and democratization.
# Supply side theories
Lay the blame for public dissatisfaction with either the process or the policy performance of democratic governments, as well as with the institutional arragnements. 

- *Process* accounts emphasize that rational citizens have the capacity to judge how democracy works in their own country; it follows that public satisfaction should reflect the quality ofdemocratic governance existing in different countries.
- *Policy* performance explanations emphasize public dissatisfaction with the capacity of governments to manage the delivery of public goods and services. If true, democratic deficits should relate to perceptual and/or aggregate indicators of policy outputs and outcomes
- *Structural* accounts emphasize that democratic deficits are conditioned by the constitutional arrangements in any state, especially by power-sharing arrangements. If correct, satisfacrion with democracy should prove greater among electoral winners than losers, as well as being minimized in countries with power-concentrating regimes.
# Counsequences of Democratic Deficits
"The democratic deficit has important consequences - including for political activism, for allegiant forms of political behavior and rule of law ,and ultimately for processes of democratization".
# Theoretical Framework
## Five components of 'political support'
1. The most general and fundamental feelings of citizens toward **belonging to the national community**, examplified by feelings of national pride and identity.
2. **Suport for general regime principles**, including approval of democrativ and autocratic values.
3. **Evaluations of the overall performance of the regime**, exemplified by satisfaction with the workings of democracy.
4. **Confidence in state institutions**, notably governments, parliaments, parties, the civil service, the courts, and the security forces.
5. Trust in elected and appointed **officeholders**, including politicians and leaders.
