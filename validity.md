# Determining a measures validity
- **Face validity**: Whether or not, on its face, the measure appears to be measuring what it purports to be measuring.
- **Content validity**: A rigorous process that forces the researcher to come up with a listof all of the critical elements that, as a group, defind the concept we wish to measure.
- **Construct validity**: The degree to which the measure is related to other measures that theory requires them to be related to.
