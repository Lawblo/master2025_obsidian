Also known as the **standard error of the mean**.

The [[standard deviation]] of the sampling [[distribution]] of sample [[mean|means]].
A measure of uncertainty about a statistical estimate.

$$
\frac
{\text{sample standard deviation}}
{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
$$

Larger $se$ -> more uncertainy in ability to make precise statements.
