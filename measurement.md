Some [[variables]] are very easy to measure, whereas others, because of the nature of what we are trying to measure, will always be elusive.

Measuring concepts of interest properly requires us to be concerned about
- conceptual clarity 
- [[reliability]] 
- [[validity]]

Any conceivable measures that are reliable but invalid will not be useful in evaluating causal theories. I
It is theoretically possible to have valid but unreliable measures, but those measures also will be problematic for evaluating causal theories, because we will have no confidencein the hypothesis tests that we conduct. 

|              | **reliable** | **valid** |
| ------------ | :-: | :-: |
| **not reliable** |   ***    |  Unreliable measures lead to unreliable hypothesis tests |
| **not valid**    | An invalid measure despite reliability, cannot be used meaningfully in hypothesis testing|  Measures that are both reliable and valid can be used to test hypotheses |

Different measurement strategies can and sometimes do produce different conclusions about causal relationships. 
Measurement cannot take place in a theoretical vacuum.
