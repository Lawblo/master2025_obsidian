The comparative perspective is almost needed in political studies. This can be because a cross-temporal, cross-space, or cross-societal prespective is widely used in political studies. Even in international relations, even though there is only one world system, there are still trans-national polities, such as the EU.  
# Phases of Comparative politics

There have been several periods of relative tranquility in comparative politics, where one paradigm had been dominated. 

## 1950s
Focused on comparing constitutions and other formal institutions of Europe and North America.
Some comments about more informal aspects of national character and culture.

## #behavioralism
Mass sample surveys were applied across several polities, in order to discover a common social base of electoral result, distinguish between 'bourgeois/materialist' and 'post-bourgeois/post-materialist' values, and to search for a common 'civic culture' that was thought to be needed for stable democracy.   

## Aggregate data analysis
Quantitative indicators of economic development, social structure, regime type, and public policy, at national and sub-national level. 

## #structural_functionalism
Attempted to identify universal tasks that all political systems has to fulfill, regardless of formal institutions or informal behaviours. 


## The present and future of comparative politics


The author of the articles assumes that the future of comparative politics should diverge to some degree from the trends and trajectories followed in the recent years by a majority o f political scientits in the US.

At some point or another, these disciplines had their time on top, but none has become 'hegemonic' . They all still exist in some form or another. 
A problem is that people within different paradigms aren't communicating, and aren't acknowledging their shared historical foundations. 

On a positive note, it seem like there's and increase in students that are explicitly defending their choices of cases, both number and characteristics, as opposed to assuming that the choices are not necessary to explain. This is important, because the number of cases, and what those cases are, can be of great significance to the outcome of the research.  

There are critisisms about the 'non-cummulative' nature of the knowledge gathered by comparative politics, BUT there has emerged some continuous lines of reserach. 
Some examples are democratization studies, and there's been some common tradition in regional integration studies, despite some fundamental theory-based differences.

Although quantitative reserachers has tried to assert their intrinsic 'scientific' superiority over more qualitative reasearch designs, there has been an increased agreement that many of the problems of design and inference are common to both choices. 

More and more common to combine qualitative and quantitative methods, in the words of #Tilly, with combining 'lumping' and 'splitting'. 

### The 'real challenge' of comparative politics

Third option: 'formal modeling' based on rational choice.
An attempt to imitate the perceived 'success' of the economics profession.
An attempt to establis a foundation of theoretical (neo-liberal) and methodological (mathematical modeling) orthodoxy.
Accpets a a stronger set of limiting initial assumptions:
- Rational calculations of individual actors to provide 'micro-foundations'
- Reliance on 'stylized facts' and 'mathematical proofs' to demonstrate the correctness of initial assumptions and their derived hypothesises. 

## Origins of Comparative politics

![[Pasted image 20230823152440.png]]
Deepest root in the 'genealogical tree' of comparative politics lie in *sociological constitutionalism*, invented by Aristoteles, that laid a foundation for later innovations.
Following was a group labeled under *Dead White European Males*, which included people such as Machiavelli, Marx, Tocqueville, Weber, Durkheim, etc.
This branch was further extended and premuated to a branch called *historical political sociology* that appeared in the decades immediatily following WWII. This included people such as Rokkan, Kirchheimer, Lipset, Linz, etc.   
Another root lies in *legal constitutionalism*, initiaded by, among others, Duguit, Burdeau, Wilson, and later developed subsequently by Duverger, Sartori, etc. 
Several comparativist are difficult to place, such as Huntington, Dahl, and Deutsch. 

In the 20th century, political science has made use of conceptual and methodological innovations from other disciplines, such as *social psychology* with the *behaviorist movement*, and its use of comparative survey research, and later from *anthropology* with the *structural-functionalist approach*.
The behaviorist movement has been the most distinctive contrivution of Americanpolitical science to the sub-discipline The anthropological graft has received less attraction, but contributed by increasing the range of countries examined. 

When examining non-Western politics, scholars found i difficult to apply the previous legal or scoiological categories, and moved in a direction where *functions* that presumably had to be performed by *structures* in all political systems. These functions were however found to be to abstract, and the structures never really fit the examined unit.  

Comparativists have always borrowed ideas from *economics*. The biggest effect of this borrowing has been the transfer of root assumptions, deductive thinking, and mathematical modeling techniques into the study of politics. This started in studies of American politics, and have later included studies of 'other people's politics'.  

At the top of the tree lies the *institutionalists*, which contains a lot of differing ideas, with the only agreement seems to be that 'institutions matter'. There doesn't seem to be an agreement about hhat institutions are, or how they came about.
Some of the institutionalists also admit that other things matter, such as collective identities, citizen attidues, cultural values, etc., even when it comes to explaining and understanding political matters. 

## Comparative politics at a crossroads

The road ahead for comparative politics seems to be headed in three possible directions, but it seems unlikely that comparative politics will end up in a single peak:
- More complexity
- More simplicity -> An economification of political reserach
- More institutionalism

The responsibility of comparative politics will however still include *objective description* of processes and events. Phenomena such as *globalization of capitalism* and the ubiquitous penetration of *mass media* also require further attention. Further comparisons between polities in reseraching the causes and consequences of politics.  

There is a danger that the evolution of comparative politics will split the differing sub-dicsiplinces and reduce communication and cross-fertilization between the branches. One way this can happen is with the simplification route decrying the others as 'less scientific'. 

Article argues for comparative politics as a field to move in the direction of more complexity, as opposed to new versions of institutionalism or towards simplification (rational choice etc). Institutionalism and simplification has reached a stage of diminishing returns. 

A possible path with more complexification, with less well-defined and less self-confident scholars, would lead to:
- Accepting fewer and less restictive initial assumptions.
- Assuming that micro-foundation can't be based on individual persons, and must also include collectives that can't be decomposed into the preferences or action of individuals. Multiple levels of political authority and power matter.
- Rely upon 'reasonableness' instead of rationality. The sheer number of actors involved makes it less optimal to attempt to aggregate into a model actor. 
- Consider that *fallacies of composition* could be converted into *laws of composition* to explain outcomes where multiple layers of different types of actors from a plurality of centers of power and aythority bargain and deliberate with each other #hmm
- Respect for 'real' data. Be suspicious of 'stylized' facts that supress confounding observations or simulations using mathematical equations. 
- Endogenize as many potential causal variables as possible, even those who may be difficult to do so with. 

Be wary of selection of units. There has been (and may still be) a tendency to assume that states or polities are a good unit of measurements, without examining external factors, such as trans-national organization, cooperation between similar regions in different national states, globalization, etc etc. 

Effects of globalization may require a paradigm shift withing comparative politics. One of these shifts could be a move away from the nation state as the default unit of measurment. 

This could be required if either
1. Globalization narrows the range of political actions a state can take, such that the states no longer can be responsive to their citizens and lose legitimacy. 
2. Globalization makes more resources availabel to non-state actors acting across state borders. This would shift policy responsibility upwards to the trans-national level and make the non-state actors more independent of the nation state, and could lead to more similarities within the trans-national unit.  

Comparativists should take more care to consider what makes a relevant and equivalent case when the puzzle to analyze has been decided, and *before* the number and types of units are chosen. 

Article argues for a move away from the state centric view. 

- Problematic assumptions accompanying the use of variables
	- Presumed to cover causal relations independent of eachother
	- Presumed to make independent and equibalent cotribution to explauning outcome.
