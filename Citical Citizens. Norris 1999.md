Continued work past "Norris 1997, Why People Don't Trust the Government" which found that confidence in US govt has sharply declined past 30 yrs.
# Is declining trust a problem? 
Jeffersonian tradition says that we shouldnt worry about trust in govt. May even be healthy.

Seems like not a "crisis of democracy", but rather growing erosion of support for both public and private institutions.

- Diagnostic: 
	- How far are there legitimate grounds for concern about declining public support for representative democracy world-wide?
	- Are trends towards growing cynisicm with govt in US evident in many established and newer democracies?
- Analytical:
	- What are the main political, economic, and cultural factors driving the dynamics of support for democratic government?
- Prescriptive:
	- What are the consequences and implications?

Concept of political trust is multi-dimensional, and every cases needs to specify its object. There are differences between support for the political community, regime, and authorities.

# The Conceptual Framework for Critical Citizens
Book uses fiverfold conceptual framework of political support. Dimensions are often blurred. Builds on Easton's analytical framework (1965, 1975) that distinguishes between support for the community, the regime, and the authorities.

## Regime Performance
Commonly measured by 'satisfaction with the performance of democracy'. #klingemann argues that the focus on 'how democacy is working' seem to make it a suitable item to test public evaluation of democratic performance more than principles.

- #fuchs: ch 6

### Governement Performance
"Studies in political economy have argue that regime support is influenced by public evaluations government performance":
- Weil 1989
- Weatherford 1984, 1987, 1992
- Clarke, Dutt, and Kornberg 1993
- Lockerbie 1993
- Anderson 1995
- Weisberg 1996

# #mcallister ch9: Confidence in political institutions
"What conceptually and operationally constitutes a measure of government performance?"
- does expectations change?
- objective indicators
	- inflation
	- unemployment
	- govt deficits
	- support for government
- expectations

"If government was responsible for providing public services such as medical care, unemployment insurance, or pension benefits, and some or all of these services deteriorated or failed to meet public demands, a growing discontent with government might result." 

"Measuring how effectively the government delivers certain public services raises problems in the comparative framework, as some services may be more critical to assessing the performance of some governemtnts than others." $\Longrightarrow$ *evaluating health care more important if public*
