# 1. The Scientific Study of Politics

Causal theory -> Hypothesis -> Empirical test -> Evalutaion of hypothesis -> Evaluation of causal theory > Scientific knowledge

#theory: a tentative conjecture about the causes of som ephenomenon of interest. 

#hypothesis: A theory-based statement about a relationship that we expect to observe

#null-hypothesis: A theory-based statement about what we would observe if there were no relationship between two variables of interest

#hypothesis-testing: A process in which scientists evaluate systematically collected evidence to make a judgement of wheter the evidence favors their hypothesis or favors the corresponding null hypothesis

**Skepticism** is important for this process, where other scientists can come up with other possible tests. It is also important to be open to be proved wrong. 

#paradigm: a collection of shared assumptions and commonly accepted theories in a scientific field

#normal-science: the state of research under an accepted paradigm

When a major problem is found with the accepted theories and assumptions of a scientific field, that field will go through a **revolutionary preiod** during which new theories and assumptions replace the old paradigm to establish a new paradigm. This is called a **paradigm shift**.

Some argue that political science isn't even mature enough to have a paradigm. 

A **dependent variable** is checked for wether it depends on **independent variables** in order to find causal connections. 

## Rules about the Road to Scientific Knowledge about politics

- Focus on **causality**, as opposed to **covariation**
- Don't let data alone drive your theories
- Consider only empirical evidence
- Avoid normative statements
- Pursue both **generality** and **parsimony**

# 2. The Art of Theory Building

Three strategies for developing a new theory:
- A new **Y** (and existing **X**)
- An existing **Y** and a new **X**
- A new **Z** which modifies an established **X -> Y**

Building on previous research:
- What (if any) other causes of the dependent variable did the previous reserachers miss?
- Can their theory be applied elsewhere?
- If we believe their findings, are there further implications?
- How might this theory work at different levels of aggregation ( micro <-> macro)
