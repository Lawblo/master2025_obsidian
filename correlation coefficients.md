For [[bivariate hypothesis testing]] where both $X$ and $Y$ are continous.
**Correlation coefficient** - a measure of linear association between two continous variables. Goes form -1 to 1.

| **Correlation Coefissient**    | **Type of Relationship** | **Levels of Measurment** | **Data Distribution** |
