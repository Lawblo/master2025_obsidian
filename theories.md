Theories are statements about relationships *between concepts*. 

Think about phenomena that vary and focus on general patterns.
Strive for generalization
# Building a new theory
using [[variables#Independent and Dependent Variables|this]] notation
1. A new $Y$ (and an existing $X$)
2. An existing $Y$ and a new $X$
3. A new $Z$ which modifies an established $X \rightarrow Y$ 

- Look at existing research:
	- What was the research question/puzzle?
	- What was their theory?
	- What was their research design?
	- How did they do with the four hurdles?
	- What did they conclude?
- Develop existing research: 
	- What (if any) other causes of the dependent variable did the previous reserachers miss?
	- Can their theory be applied elsewhere?
	- If we believe their findings, are there further implications?
	- How might this theory work at different levels of aggregation (micro $\Longleftrightarrow$ macro)?
- Think formally about about the [[causality|causes]] that lead to variation in dependent variable
	- expected utility

After working on the theory, you have to consider how to [[measurement|measure]] the data
