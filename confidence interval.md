Can use [[normal distribution]] to estimate confidence intervals for unseen [[population]] mean from [[sample]] data.

Formulae for estimating confidence intervals:
$$\hat \beta \pm [t \times se(\hat \beta)]$$
$$\hat \alpha \pm [t\times se(\hat\alpha)]$$
The value for $t$ is determined from the [[t-table]], based on the [[degrees of freedom]]: $n - k$.  

$n$ = number of observations
$k$ = number of parameters estimated
