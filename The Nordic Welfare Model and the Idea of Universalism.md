Article argues for the existence a Scandinavian or Nordic welfare model or welfare regime types. 

What is meant by universalism?
Univesalisms has different meanings in different traditions of thought. Theology, moral philosophy, sociology, politics, and welfare policy. 

In welfare policy, universalism is conceptualized as a distributive principle where equity and redistribution is central. Universal policies are often contrasted with selective policies targeted at the poor, which also include insurance-absed, reciprocal ones.

Universalism contains (at least) two dimensions: Membership and allocation. 

Membership
The main characteristic of universalism is a high degree of population coverage. All members of society are beneficiaries of welfare schemes. Everyone is, however, covered as a member of a specific population category. This can be based on age, health, family status, etc. 
This means that there are few litteraly universal benefits in the Nordic countries. 
Who is included in 'all' or 'everybody' can also differ. This can include all citizens, or other times, all residents. 
There are also mixed definitions of membership both within, and between different welfare states. 

Allocation
Allocation covers the distinction between 'universal' and 'discretionary' allocations of benefits. The latter covers 'selective' policies and gatekeepers that determine the applicant' eligebility based on humiliating and integrity-violating investigations.  

Real world universal welfare states do not fit the ideal of universality with full coverage with flat-rate 'basic income'.
Universal welfare states instead use some discretionary allocations, but more for service allocations than income transfers or supports. Most social benefits are subjected to various degrees of professional discretion.

A primary function of the welfare state is to protect its members against social riks. The amount risks the Nordic welfare states has expanded gradually. 

When did the (defined) procople of universalism become embedded in the Nordic welfare state?

Nodic countries were early proponents of universal education, because of the demand for general literacy for all. The church took on this responsibility in the 16th century.
The local authorities introduced a general and compulsory system of education in the 19th century, when every child had the right to an elementary education. Denmark in 1814, Sweden in 1842, Norway in 1848, and Finland in 1866. 
Elementary education of all was partly under the influence of the French and American revolutions.

Why did it, with some exception of Iceland, become so imporant in Scandinavia and 'Norden'?

Why the more generous, earlier, and stronger welfare state in Nordics?

Structural and contextual factors conducive to Nordic universalism
- Historical-institutional prerequisites
	- limited space for market due to state and church's collaboration
	- a result of piecmeal, pragmatic learning from experience of policies and their shortcomings
	- choice of early programmes more conducive to develop into universal programmes
- Egalitarian pre-industrial society
	- Relatively independent pre-industrial peasants
	- historically early enfranchisement of peasants
	- Early agrarian political parties, creating distinct party-systems and dynamics 
	- Lack of social democratic or socialist forces conducive to universal solidaristic rather than class solidaristic
- Cultural homogeneity
	- In terms of ethnicicty, religion and language
- Extraordinary crises
	- Post WWII, drove solidarity

Who promoted the principle, with which arguments?

Goul Andersens collection of arguments for and against universalism:
- Pro:
	- Market conform -> make for fewer negative incentives for saving, employment, etc.
	- Administratively simpler
	- No incentive to abuse
	- Greater social equality
	- Non-stigmatizing
	- Create and support community feeling and social cohesion
	- support and increase citizens' resources and thus autonomy
- Con:
	- Too expensive
	- Higher taxes
	- Taxation negative impact on market
	- less social equiality
	- Inefficient priorities
	- Creates dependency cultures
	- Increased transaction costs
	- Too high expectations among citizens

Four general categories of pro arguments: 
- Community-building
- Risk exposure
- Human dignity
- Economic and bureaucratic efficiency


Is universalism still a major component of recent social and welfare policy reforms in the Nordic countries?

Several of the Nordic states has moved towards more discretionary forms of allocation.
