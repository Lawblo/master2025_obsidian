Often called the *bell curve* in common language.

Has several special properties:
1. Symmetrical about its [[mean]], such that the [[mode]], [[median]], and [[mean]] are the same
2. The normal distribution has a predictable area under the curve within specified distances of the mean. 
	- Starting from the mean and going one [[standard deviation]] in each direction above and below the mean will capture 68% of the area under the curve.
	- An additional sd will capture a shade over 95%.
	- Third sd captures 99%.
	- Commonly referred to as the **68-95-99 rule**.
