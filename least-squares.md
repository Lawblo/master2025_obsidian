The sum of the *squared differences* between each $Y$ value ($Y_i$), and the mean value of $Y$, ($\bar Y$), is less than the sum of the squared differences between each $Y$ value, ($Y_i$), and some value $c$, for all ($\forall$) $c$ values not equal to ($\neq$) $\bar Y$:
$$
\sum^n_{i = 1}
(Y_1 - \bar Y)^2
<
\sum^n_{i = 1}
(Y_i - c)^2
\forall c \neq \bar Y
$$
