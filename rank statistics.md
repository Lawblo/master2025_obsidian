Rank statistics are a measure of [[variance|variation]] of [[continuous variables]]. 

1. put the cases in order from samlles to largest
2. Measure the central tendency as the [[median]] value of the variable

The median value is also known as the value at the 50% rank. We can also talk about the values at other ranks, such as 25% and 75%, known as the [[interquartile range]], or IQR.

We also want to look at the smallest and largest values to idetify [[outliers]].
