**Esping-Andersens three types of welfare state regimes**
Article surveys the debate regarding #esping-andersen's typology of welfare states and ensuing typologies. Esping-Andersen originally published the typology in his *Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism* in 1990. 

The reason given for Esping-Andersen's work was that there had been given too little attention to cross-national differences between welfare states.

Esping-Andersen argues that different types of welfare-states are clustered around three highly diverse regime-types, each organized to its own discrete logic of organization, stratification, and societal integration.

- **Conservative**
	- Moderale level of decommodificatio; social benefits mainly dependent on former contributions and status
- **Liberal** 
	- Low level of decommodification; market-differentiation of welfare
- **Social-democratic** 
	- High level of decommodification; universal benefits and high degree of benefit equality

There have been a large number of alternative ideal-types based on different indicators/dimensions. Esping-Andersen base his types on two dimensions:
- Decommodification
	- The removal certain goods from the market
- Stratification
	- The arrangement or classification of something into different groups


Real world likely to have hybrids. 
**Article establishes**...
... whether real welfare states are quite similar to others or whether they are rather unique specimens
... whether there are three ideal-typical worlds of welfare capitalism or more

**Articles concludes that**...
... real welfare states are hardly ever pure types, and are usually hybrid cases
... the issue of ideal-typical welfare states cannot be satisfactorily answered given the lack of formal theorizing and the inconclusive outocomes of comparative research

**Article contends that** there is still reason to continue work on and with the original or modified typologies.

**Alleged shortcomings of Esping-Andersen's typology**
- Misspecification of the Mediterranean welfare states as immature Continental ones
- The labelling of the Antipoedean welfare states (Australia and New Zealand) as belonging to the 'liberal' regime type
- A neglect of the gender-dimension in social policy

**Critiques of the typology**
- The typology is neither exhaustive nor excluseive, and thus needs revising.
- Theoretical and methodological shortcomings.
- Typologies as such has no explanatory power, therefore does not contribute to proper theorizing about what is happening within and between welfare states.

**Does typologies based on ideal-types have theoretical and empirical values as Esping-Andersen assumes?**
- Typologies based on ideal types only have theoretical and empirical value if they are not goals in themselves. Instead they should be  a tool for the representation of reality.
- Typologies lose fruitfulness as the empirical sciences matures, and we move away from typologies and towards theories.
- As comparative macro-sociology of welfare states is still in an early stage, the typology could have value

Several authors seem to find Esping-Andersen’s typology fruitful.
**Abrahamson** concludes in his overview that the typologies have proven to be a very robust and convincing tool as an organizing principle for comparative studies of welfare states. 

Within the **power-resources mobilization** paradigm it has been proposed that the nature of the welfare state regime would influence support for certain forms of social policy. This hypothesis has gotten empirical support, but without really convincing evidence.

There has been more encouraging evidence when explaining cross-national differences in values with respect to welfare and care using Esping-Andersen’s typology.

**Goodwin et al.**  show that the types welfare state regimes have both intended and unintended consequences. 
Social-democratic regime succeeds in its stated goal of minimizing inequality, as well as reducing poverty, promoting stability, and social integration.

Korpi and Palme find a paradox of redistribution. The more targeted the distribution is towards the poor, and the more the creation of equality through equal public transfers to all is a matter of priority, the less equality will be reduced. 

This means that, depending on the type of welfare regime,  there aren’t only possible unintended effects, but may even be perverse effects.   

All in all, there seems to be reason to continue work on the welfare state typology, with a better formulation of the theory deserving priority.
