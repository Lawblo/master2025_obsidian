"*An illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism*" #mudde

# What is Populism? #muller 2016
- *necessary* but *not sufficient* to be **critical of elites**
- **antipluralist**
	- "They alone represent the people"
	- Only some people are really the people.
- Distinctly **moral**
	- Refuse to recognice opposition as legitimate.
	- Competitors portray their political competitors as part of the immoral, corrupt elite
	- Support for party required to be proper part of the people
- Always a **form of identity politics**

Muller argues that populism is not anything like a codified doctrine, but is aset of distinct claims with what one might call an inner logic. When examined, this logic is not a useful corrective for a democracy that somehow has come to be too "elite-driven".
## Dead Ends
- The american view of populism as somehow "progressive" or "grassroots" 
- Class based views
	- Usually with an additional set of criteria drawn from social psychology: populist voters are said to be driven by "fears", or feelings of "anger", "frustration", and "resentment".
- Classification of populism based on inclusion of populism in movement name

Populists long for #holism: 

>The notion that the polity should no longer be split and the idea that it's possible for thepeople to be one and - all of them - to have one true representative. (Rosenblum)

In reality, the idea of one unified of the people is fantasy.

Not all appeals to "the people" qualify as populism, but rather actors or movements that claim that *part* of the people *is* the people, and that only the populist authentically identifies and represents this real or true people.

Populists do not have to be against the idea of representation as such; rather, they can positively endorse a particular version of it. 

## Three Populist Techniques for Governing and Their Moral Justifications

1. Populists tend to colonize or "occuppy" the state.
2. Mass clientelism: The exchange of material and immaterial facors by elites for mass political support.
3. Populists in power tends to be harsh with NGOs.

What separates populists from others who use similar stratergies is the fact that they do these in the open.

# Populism: An Ideational Approach, #mudde 2017

## Mudde's definition of populism:
>"An **ideology** that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenouse and antagonistic groups, **'the pure people'** versus **'the corrupt elite'**, andwhich argues that politics should be an expression of the **general will** of the people"

### Ideology
Populsism is a **thin ideology**, which means that it exhibits **"a restricted core attached to a narrower range of political concepts"**, as opposed to **thick ideologies**, which forumulate **"a broad menu of solutions to major social-political issues"**
### The People
The key core concept of populism. Argued to be a mere construction. 

### The Elite
Viewed as morally opposed to "the people". Doesn't include all who are not part of "the people".

### General Will
Populists argue that politics should follow the general will of the people. With "the people" seen as a homogenouse group, it is also seen as having the same interests and preferences. Populists presents their solutions as following "the general will", while the corrupt elite follows "special interests".

## Strengths of the Ideational Approach
1. **Distinguishability**: Sets clear boundaries
2. **Categorizability**: Allows for the construction of logical taxonomies
3. **Travelability**: Enables cross-national and cross-regional "travel"
4. **Versatility**: Can be applied at different levels of analysis
